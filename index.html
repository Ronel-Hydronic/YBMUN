        <h2>Welcome to YBMUN IV</h2>
        <p>Dear Delegates and Faculty Advisors,</p>
        <p>YBMUN is back. Bigger, stronger, and more impactful than ever before!</p>
        <p>As the Secretary-General, it is my distinct honour to invite you to YBMUN IV. This conference is not merely about debate and diplomacy; it is much more than that. You are pushed beyond your limits on all fronts, forced to be on your toes and test your negotiation skills to their fullest. But most importantly, it prompts you to focus on global concerns and how you, as both a concerned citizen and a dignified diplomat, can bring about a change for the better. Taking note of the pressing issues of the present and the near future, the theme of YBMUN Chapter IV is <strong>"Peace - Our Common Future."</strong></p>
        
        <p>Speaking about my MUN experience, I've been an active participant since 8th grade and it has transformed me as a person entirely. Having been on both sides of the committee, as a delegate and a chair, I can confidently say that MUNs are not all about speeches; rather, they gauge you on all aspects, from attacking and countering to diplomacy and deliberation. However, the most significant skills that you learn and hone through MUNs are your research, critical thinking, and negotiating skills, all of which are indispensable in this fast-paced and competitive world.</p>
        
        <p>We at YBMUN promise to provide a platform to do just that. Commencing our fourth chapter since our humble start as an intraschool MUN back in 2021, we have grown exponentially each year. I can proudly say that I've been part of each of the chapters. From being a member of the OC, a delegate, a vice chair, and now as the Secretary-General, I have had the privilege of watching this conference grow in all its different aspects.</p>

        <p>This year is no different from the previous when it comes to the excitement, competition and a wide spectrum of committees to choose from, while factoring in the varied experience levels of the delegates.</p>
        
        <p>A special note to all the first timers: There is absolutely nothing you have to worry about. Feel free to reach out to us in case of any clarifications; our sole focus is to make sure that you have an exhilarating and enriching conference with a lot of memories to take back.</p>

        <p>On behalf of the entire YBMUN team, I speak for all of us when I say how excited we are to host this year's conference, and it would be our pleasure if you could join us. Every one of you brings a distinct perspective to the agenda which is enthusiastically welcomed. We hope you have a remarkable experience with us; one where you leave with a full heart.</p>
        
        <p>May fortune favour your endeavours. I wish you all Godspeed!</p>

        <p><strong>Sincerely,</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Dhairya Bagri</strong><br>
        Secretary-General<br>
        Yuvabharathi Model United Nations IV</p>
